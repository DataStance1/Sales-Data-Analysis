# Sales-Data-Analysis
This is the first project in MeriSkill one-month virtual internship
#
In this project, fictitious company sales data were provided and I was asked to analyse the data and drive insights into sales trends, best-selling products and key KPIs like total sales, orders, profit etc.
#
* The data was opened in a spreadsheet and preliminary data assessment was done to ensure that the data is clean and fit for analysis
* The data was connected to Tableau
* A summary sales dashboard with the Insights and KPIs was built after the analysis
